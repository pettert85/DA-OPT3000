# Compulsory School Assignments:

**Traveling salesman problem using three different algorithms for an initial solution, aswell as a 2 algirithms for improvement of these**
In this assignment , we are going to solve the travelling salesman problem.
The number of cities is a graph  having 500. Each city is connected to all remaining cities. This means that a graph with 20 cities will have 19 edges.

* 1:  Calculate an initial solution using random method, iterative random method, and greedy method.
* 2:  Improve  each  starting solution using greedy improvement and greedy random algorithm.
* 3:  Run you algorithm  with 50 , 100, 250, 500 cities. What are your conclusions.

**Solving the knapsack problem using a genetic algorithm approach**

In this assignment , a genetic algorithm is used in  to solve the knapsack problem.  Given a set of objects each having a value and a weight , use the genetic algorithm to solve the problem. The number of objects is a number of your choice. The weight is a random number between 1 and 10. The  value for each object is a random  number between 1 and 99. Use a population of 4 individuals.The students  having  difficulties in programming should show how the different steps of the  genetic algorithm works using  10 objects.
